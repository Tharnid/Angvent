End of Routing Exercises to try:

1.  convert editprofile.html to the new template in the SPA, add a route, and a link.
	(will have to try this)
2.  create a route that requires no template or controller...like the hello world thing jim 
	did in the videos (hmmmm)

3.  Add a resolve property to the /events route...ummm this didn't work for me...so that it does
	not load until the events have been loaded from disk.

	I will do these, but I need to plug along in this course...maybe I comeback and do them
	later
